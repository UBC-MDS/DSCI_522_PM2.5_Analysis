# Plan in Proposal


First of all, we will select the columns of the time information and the place information, as well as the PM2.5 values, which will be used in our project. Then, for each day, we will calculate the average PM2.5 of all places and all hours as an observation of the specific day. Furthermore, we would use the wrangled data to show comparison between PM2.5 of Beijing and Shanghai by visualiztion and hypothesis testing.

The Null/Alternative Hypothesises are as follows:

- Null Hypothesis: The average PM2.5 in Beijing is the same as the average PM2.5 in Shanghai.

- Alternative Hypothesis: The average PM2.5 in Beijing is NOT the same as the average PM2.5 in Shanghai.

And we would show the test results and necessary visualization.
