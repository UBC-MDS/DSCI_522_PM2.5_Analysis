# Report

## Introduction
This project is to conduct research on the inferential question - **Is the average PM2.5 in Beijing same as that in Shanghai?** We want to explore whether the average PM2.5 in Beijing is different from that in Shanghai in general. The datasets we choose are [PM2.5 Data of Five Chinese Cities from Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pm25-data-for-five-chinese-cities), which record PM2.5 of five Chinese cities during 2010 to 2015. Because we only care about PM2.5 in Beijing and Shanghai, these two raw datasets are as below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
BJ_data <- read.csv("../data/Beijing_PM.csv")
SH_data <- read.csv("../data/Shanghai_PM.csv")
```

*Table 1. Beijing PM2.5 Raw Dataset*
```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(head(BJ_data))
```


*Table 2. Shanghai PM2.5 Raw Dataset*
```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(head(SH_data))
```

To analyze the data efficiently, we need to do data wrangling on `Table 1` and `Table 2`:

* For each table, add a column `PM_Average` to record the average daily PM2.5.

* For each table, add a column `city` to indicate this categorical variable.

* Combine the two tables into one, which is `Table 3`.

*Table 3. Beijing and Shanghai PM2.5 Tidy Dataset*

```{r, echo = FALSE}
BJSH_data <- read.csv("../data/tidy_data.csv")
kable(head(BJSH_data))
```



## Visualization

To understand the dataset, we take two plots to visualize it.

### Histogram

*Figure 1. Histograms of Beijing PM and Shanghai PM*

![](../results/histogram.png)

It shows the distributions of PM2.5 in Shanghai and Beijing. Both are right-skewed. Looking at the distribution of Beijing, the peak occurs at 25, and the data spread is from about 0 to 400. In contrast, the peak in distribution of Shanghai occurs at 50, which is larger than that of Beijing. The data spread of Shanghai is from 0 to 250, which is much narrower.

### Boxplot

*Figure 2. Boxplots of Beijing PM and Shanghai PM*

![](../results/boxplot.png)

It helps analyze the relationship between the categorical variable `city` and the continuous variable `PM_Average`. We observe that the median PM2.5 of Beijing is higher than that of Beijing. Also, the boxplot of Shanghai is comparatively short, which suggests that overall PM2.5 values of Shanghai are denser. In addition, they both have much outliers, which reveals that ralatively high PM2.5 usually detected in both cities.

## Data Summary

For each city, we can easily get the sample size, the sample mean, and the standard deviation of the sample mean. Then, assuming statistical independence of the two groups, the standard error of the mean of each city can be estimated as the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size `SE = s / sqrt(n)`. Additionally, we calculate 95% confidence interval of PM2.5 for each city using asymoptotic theory: Confidence interval = (mean -  1.96 * SE, mean +  1.96 * SE).

*Table 4. Summarize Beijing and Shanghai PM2.5 Tidy Dataset*

```{r, echo = FALSE}
summarized_data <- read.csv("../results/summarized_data.csv")
kable(head(summarized_data))
```

From `Table 4`, the PM means of the Beijing and Shanghai are totally different. Also, we are 95% confident that the average PM in Beijing is between 91.98765 and 98.44522. Comparatively, we are 95% confident that the average PM in Shanghai is between 52.87362 and 56.74973.

## Analysis and results

We performed the Welch's two sample t-test intead of student t-test in this case. The main reason is that we have a lot of missing data in both of our datasets and the sizes of two samples are different so the homogeneous assumption of student t-test may not be hold. Another reason is that when we perform Welch's t-test we will not pool the sample standard deviations and this could give us a more accurate result.

The following is our test result:

*Table 5. Summarize Beijing and Shanghai PM2.5 Tidy Dataset*

```{r, echo = FALSE}
results <- read.csv("../results/results.csv")
kable(head(results),digits = 100)
```

As we can see in the above table, p-value is extremely small and this is a strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

The above plot shows that our test statistic is far right of the threshold and this is another evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

In conclusion, we reject the null hypothesis that there's no difference between the mean PM in Beijing and Shanghai. 

## Beyond the project

There are some limitations in our analysis:

  - The datasets we are using are time series data which means there exists dependencies in the datasets. For example, there could be a strong relationship between today's PM2.5 and tomorrow's PM2.5.
  
  - We have ignore many valuable features in the datasets due to time constraint. For example, we could include humidity and temperature of each day and create a regression model with PM2.5 value.
